# Household Power Consumption Analysis and Prediction
## Project Description
This project analyzes household electricity consumption data to uncover trends,
handle missing values and prepare the dataset for forecasting. The goal is to clean and preprocess the data, 
explore energy usage patterns within three months intervals, and set the foundation for basic (beginner) predictive modelling.

This project also serves as a means to practice ARMA model skills.
